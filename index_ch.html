								<p>DNA nanotechnology has proliferated as investigators have increasingly
									harnessed the selectivity of DNA base pairing to form multitudes of diverse structures, with
									a wide range of applications. My researches focusing on a multi-level strategy to demonstrate new horizons of coarse-grained simulation
									systems. With the service of this multi-level coarse-grained strategy, a more realistic simulation
									system can be devoted to illustrate more reliable physical properties.</p>

										<h3 class="major">DNA-Functionalised Triblock Copolymers: F108 Pluronics + DNA</h3>
										<p>Pluronics®are triblock copolymers (referred to as 'PEO-PPO-PEO') that have two hydrophilic
											polyethylene oxide (PEO) outer blocks and an inner block of polypropylene 
											oxide (PPO) that is hydrophilic at low temperatures but becomes hydrophobic upon heating. 
											These block copolymers are polymeric surfactants, commercially also known
											as Poloxamers®, and are widely used in lubrication, detergency, pharmaceuticals, foaming,
											emulsification and coating.
											In this projects, I built a coarse-grained simulation model with temperature-sensitive hydrophobic monomers to study the
											structure and phase behaviour of a symmetric bead-spring model for the PEO-PPO-PEO
											polymers. Further, we extended our model by adding a sticky patch to each free PEO
											chain, thus mimicking the complementary DNA sticky ends. This stickiness provides an
											additional, temperature dependent driving force for aggregation between two chain ends
											at low temperatures.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Towards New Liquid Crystal Phases of DNA Mesogens</h3>
										<p> Liquid crystals play an essential role in biology because they combine order and mobility, offering
											a basic requirement for self-organisation and structure formation in all living systems.
											The ability of dsDNA to form LC phases when it is hydrate was first demonstrated in the
											1940s. Since that time, the LC properties of aqueous suspensions of DNA have been
											extensively characterised. The geometry and physical characteristics of DNA are closely
											related to its chemical structure.
											In this research, I report on the second-level coarse-graining of the nunchucks DNA towards
											finding new liquid phase transitions. I did this work with Kit Gallagher as a day-to-day
											supervisor in his part III project. To begin with, we developed the LAMMPS code in
											single-stage, rigid-rod simulations to confirm that the analytical techniques could accurately
											recreate Onsager’s theory. Then we investigated a system of stiff rods and concentrated on
											the transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase.</p>

										<h3 class="major">The Role of Flexible Joints in a Linker-Mediated DNA Hydrogel</h3>
										<p>DNA hydrogels are polymeric networks made entirely from DNA. The convenient programmability
											and multi-functional tunability of DNA make it a perfect material for constructing
											a three-dimensional structure in hydrogels. DNA hydrogels are also biocompatible
											and therefore useful for biomedical applications such as bio-sensing technology, targeted
											drug delivery, 3D bio-printing, regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.
											In this research, I reported numerical work using oxDNA to test the thermodynamic stability
											and topography of Y-shaped DNA nanostars connected via rigid, linear DNA-linkers. The
											specific DNA sequences we used were those we tested in experiments to study the formation
											of DNA hydrogels as function of temperature and DNA concentration. This work was done
											in collaboration with Dr. Iliya Stoev, who did most of the experiments in this project. Our
											dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements showed that when inserting sufficiently long
											flexible ssDNA joints between the linear linker and the Y-shaped DNA we suppress gelation.
											This motivated me to test the effect of the length of the flexible joints.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Determining the micellisation phase boundary for multiblock copolymers </h3>
										<p>	Multiblock copolymers are creative building blocks in the repertoire of self-assembled
											polymeric micelles, with practical applications in nanoscience and biotechnology.
											Amongst the many different polymeric surfactants are the symmetric ABA-type triblock
											copolymers PEO-PPO-PEO. The micellisation of block copolymers in solutions is inherently complex as the 
											critical micellisation temperature (CMT) increase
											with decreasing concentration. Even above the CMT, unimers, micelles and
											micellar aggregates coexist, and the relative proportion of each species depends strongly on
											the temperature and polymer concentration. The CMT can be determined
											experimentally by fluorescence spectroscopy, surface tension, solubilisation methods, light
											scattering and rheology. In simulations, the exact aggregation number
											of each micelle is known; hence a more direct method can be applied to investigate
											the unimer/micellar status in an equilibration period to determine the micellisation phase
											boundary.</p>

									Beecroft Building, Department of Physics, University of Oxford.
									<br>
								The workshop held in Oxford from September 2019. The aim of the workshop is to bring together both developers 
								and users of the oxDNA and oxRNA models not only to share current research projects, 
								but also to set the agenda for the future development of the oxDNA and oxRNA models, code and infrastructure. 
								Particular to advance the inter-operability of DNA design and simulation tools, user-friendly tools to improve oxDNA accessibility for non-expert users. 
								I was invited as a contriubtor for brain-storm and presentation of the next-generation of software developments.
								I presented a talk about 'Numerical Study on the Effect of Flexibility in DNA Building Blocks'. <br> </p>
