									<p>DNA nanotechnology has proliferated as investigators have increasingly
										harnessed the selectivity of DNA base pairing to form multitudes of diverse structures, with
										a wide range of applications. My research focusing on a
										homemade multi-level strategy to demonstrate new horizons of coarse-grained simulation
										systems. With the service of this multi-level coarse-grained strategy, a more realistic simulation
										system can be devoted to illustrate more reliable physical properties.</p>

											<h3 class="major">DNA-Functionalised Triblock Copolymers: F108 Pluronics + DNA</h3>
											<p>I built a coarse-grained simulation model with temperature-sensitive hydrophobic monomers to study the
												structure and phase behaviour of a symmetric bead-spring model for the PEO-PPO-PEO
												polymers. Further, we extended our model by adding a sticky patch to each free PEO
												chain, thus mimicking the complementary DNA sticky ends. This stickiness provides an
												additional, temperature dependent driving force for aggregation between two chain ends
												at low temperatures.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Towards New Liquid Crystal Phases of DNA Mesogens</h3>
											<p>I report on the second-level coarse-graining of the nunchucks DNA towards
												finding new liquid phase transitions. I did this work with Kit Gallagher as a day-to-day
												supervisor in his part III project. To begin with, we developed the LAMMPS code in
												single-stage, rigid-rod simulations to confirm that the analytical techniques could accurately
												recreate Onsager’s theory. Then we investigated a system of stiff rods and concentrated on
												the transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase.</p>

											<h3 class="major">The Role of Flexible Joints in a Linker-Mediated DNA Hydrogel</h3>
											<p>I reported numerical work using oxDNA to test the thermodynamic stability
												and topography of Y-shaped DNA nanostars connected via rigid, linear DNA-linkers. The
												specific DNA sequences we used were those we tested in experiments to study the formation
												of DNA hydrogels as function of temperature and DNA concentration. This work was done
												in collaboration with Dr. Iliya Stoev, who did most of the experiments in this project. Our
												dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements showed that when inserting sufficiently long
												flexible ssDNA joints between the linear linker and the Y-shaped DNA we suppress gelation.
												This motivated me to test the effect of the length of the flexible joints.</p>

												polymeric micelles, with practical applications in nanoscience and biotechnology.
												Amongst the many different polymeric surfactants are the symmetric ABA-type triblock
												copolymers PEO-PPO-PEO, which are known as Pluronic but have also other commercial
